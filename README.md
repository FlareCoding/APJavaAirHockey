# APJavaAirHockey
This is a multiplayer Air-Hockey game written in Java along with its own 2D graphics engine. I wrote this game for my AP Computer Science A class in my senior year of high school.

When you first launch the game, you will be prompted to enter the IP and port information to connect to. (Peer-to-peer connection)<br/>
In order to be the host, just enter ```0.0.0.0@port``` as the IP and replace the ```port``` with the desired port number.
